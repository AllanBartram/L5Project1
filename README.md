<h1><u>4RUNNERS</u></h1>

Welcome to 4RUNNERS, your go-to online store for performance running clothing. This project includes a responsive website featuring product cards, a store page, and information about the four fictitious runners who founded 4RUNNERS.

The design I have chosen harnesses the passion and love I have for running. I have chosen to create a website to sell running clothing online.

I have decided on the name 4RUNNERS, as to my knowledge and through a Google search I can not find anyone using this name. 4RUNNERS is a play on the word 4=For to show that this website is designed ‘for runners.’

I wanted to keep the design colours simple and therefore have chosen for a black and white theme.
